We host a range of (<sup>14</sup>C) preparatory services at the Ramped PyrOx facility, one of which, a detailed programmed-temperature pyrolysis/combustion methodology for radiocarbon (<sup>14</sup>C) analysis. This apparatus is known in publications as Ramped Pyrolysis, Ramped PyrOx, and RPO (affectionately known as the Dirt Burner). The method separates different acid insoluable organic carbon components from several sources that may contain a distribution of ages. The approach has improved sediment chronology in sediments proximal to Antarctic ice shelves, it has identified the flux of petrocarbon to the seafloor following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and used to aportion the amount of carbon being transported by rivers to the ocean. Check out the publications tab for different uses of this method!
