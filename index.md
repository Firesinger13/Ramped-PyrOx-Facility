# The Ramped PyrOx Facility - Enhancing your Age Model

We host a range of prepatory services at the Ramped PyrOx facility, the most famous being a detailed programmed-temperature pyrolysis/combustion methodology for radiocarbon (<sup>14</sup>C) dating of sediment. This apparatus is known as the 'Dirt Burner'. The method targets the autochthonous organic component in sediments that contain a distribution of acid-insoluble organic components from several sources of different ages. The approach has improved sediment chronology in organic-rich sediments proximal to Antarctic ice shelves, it has identified the flux of petrocarbon to the seafloor following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill..and it could help you develop a more accurate and precise chronology for your archive.
