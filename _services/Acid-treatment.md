Ramped PyrOx samples must be treated with acid to remove carbonate material

# Why?

While you may have foraminifera, ostracods, or other contemporary califying creatures present in your sample, a large portion of allochthonous carbonate material is likely present. This will cause a smearing of the age spectrum to erronous older ages. 

Samples are rinsed with 10% HCl at room temperature for 60 minutes to dissolve carbonates while minimizing hydrolysis of organic material. The sediment sample is rinsed numerous times until a pH of ~6 is reached. Samples are then dried in a low-temperature oven for 24 hours.

Clients can submit samples for acid treatment, or may elect to pretreat their samples prior to arrival at USF for a reduced rate.
