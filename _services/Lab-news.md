The application of the Bayesian statistical accumulation model and Gas-Ion Source in tandem guided real-time 14C measurements by identifying each subsequent interval to quantify. Non-sequential dating iteratively improved uncertainty but with diminishing return on age constraint, providing the operator with knowledge on when to conclude analysis.
This method can be used in combination with conventional graphitization 14C dates, as provision of denser dating around a precise baseline chronology. Additionally conventional AMS dates with higher precision can be used to improve a Bayesian model that shows a higher frequency of reversals, hiatuses, etc. than occurred in this core. This approach required less interpolation between discrete data points and resulted in better chronostratigraphic characterization of the archive when compared to a previously established chronology.
