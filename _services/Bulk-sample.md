Traditional Radiocarbon Dating

## Organic Carbon and Carbonate Minerals

We also prepare bulk sediment/carbonate material for radiocarbon determination. This is the most common way of developing an age model for an archive and allows scientists to constrain events in Earth's recent history (~300-50,000 years ago)

Clients often radiocarbon date bulk sediment/carbonate material in addition to the Ramped PyrOx method to demonstrate the necessity of this technique.
