Is Ramped PyrOx the right decision for your sample?

## Ramped PyrOx 5 split run

This method uses increasing temperature to thermally break down organic carbon. The incremental pyrolysis is slow enough to allow for the separation of more thermochemically reactive constituents from more diagenetically stable ones. The typical Ramped PyrOx 5 Split run is used to separate a sample into 5 aliquots of CO<sub>2</sub>. The CO<sub>2</sub> ampules are submitted to an AMS laboratory, where they are graphitized and analysed for <sup>14</sup>C. We take the raw data and apply a blank correction based on standards with known <sup>14</sup>C content.

## Ramped PyrOx X split run

This method is identical to the 5 split run except we collect a different number of splits. We have performed 3 split runs, we have processed 9 split runs. The amount of splits can depend on the scientific question and available funding. However, 5 split runs are the most usual and typically produce the best spectrum of ages.

## Subt et al., 2017 method

This is a method employed on highly detrital systems. When there is not enough autochthonous organic carbon present, even a Ramped PyrOx 5 split run may not produce a representative date of the youngest material. The first (youngest) split contains low proportions of contemporaneously deposited material, too low to fully separate from the detrital carbon component.
