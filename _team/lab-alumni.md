PhD  2021 University of South Florida\
M.S. 2015 Indiana State University\
B.S. 2013 Indiana University Northwest

Current: Postdoctoral Fellow, School of Science and Engineering, Tulane University 

## Research Interests
I am an isotope geochemist who seeks to understand the co-evolution of interlinked cryospheric, geologic, biologic, and oceanographic systems. My research centers on the the application of geochemical tools to extend our record of Antarctic Ice Sheet change into the recent geologic past using presently ice covered archives.

I am currently (beginning February, 2021) a postdoctoral fellow at Tulane University working to understand the recent history of the Thwaites-Pine Island glacier system as part of the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration. I recently completed my Ph.D. at the University of South Florida (January, 2021) where I worked to reconstruct Holocene grounding line history in the southern Ross Sea Embayment as part of the Subglacial Antarctic Lakes Scientific Access (SALSA) Project.
