I am a first-year geological oceanography student working in Dr. Brad Rosenheimâ€™s lab. While I currently do not have a specific research project, I am interested in carbon cycling, examining global sea level changes, and the application of clumped isotope studies to marine environments. I am extremely excited to start tackling my research interests at CMS and contribute to the oceanography scientific community.

# WHY USF CMS?

During my undergraduate career at Pacific Lutheran University, I became extremely fascinated by oceanography and marine geology. I knew that I wanted to pursue further education in oceanography and my mentor suggested that I consider CMS. I chose CMS because of its emphasis in research and interdisciplinary nature. I also chose CMS because of the extremely strong community connection that I experienced when I visited. I am confident that CMS will assist me to become a strong oceanographer, while also providing information that I can take to educate others about the importance of the ocean.
