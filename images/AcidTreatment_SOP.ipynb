    "# Acid Treatment of Organic Samples to Remove Carbonate Minerals\n",
    " \n",
    " ## Rosenheim Laboratory\n",
    " \n",
    " **Introduction**: In order to isotopically analyze organic matter in a sample, we want to remove mineral carbonates (biogenic and detrital, calcium and other).  The reason for this is becasue carbonate minerals are generally created by different processes than organic matter and thus different fractionation processes are responsible for their isotopic signatures.  Furthermore, if you are interested in the radiocarbon age interpretation of the $^{14}$C/$^{12}$C ratio of the samples, then removal of mineral carbonates eliminates a source of ambiguity that can arise if the carbonates are formed at different times and by different processes than the organic matter.\n",
    " \n",
    " Acid treatment is done by acid rinsing in our laboratory.  Other labs use a more efficient method of *acid fumigation*, which protects some water soluble organic matter.  However, that method does not produce good results for Ramped PyrOx analysis.  Because of that, we prefer to use acid rinsing for both typical Elemental Analyzer analysis and for Ramped PyrOx analysis. \n",
    " \n",
    " **Objective**: To calculate the amount of acid needed to add to a given sample for removal of mineral carbonates.\n",
    " \n",
    " **Materials**: \n",
    " >- Solid sample (soil, sediment)\n",
    " >- Balance \n",
    " >- Clean glass beaker or centrifuge tube\n",
    " >- Centrifuge tube rack if using the centrifuge tube instead of beaker. \n",
    " >- 10% (1N) Hydrochloric acid (HCl (aq))\n",
    " >- Glass stir bar, cleaned for organic matter contamination\n",
    " \n",
    " **Outline of Procedure**:\n",
    " We first assume that the mass of the sample is *entirely calcium carbonate*. Why? Calcium carbonate is the most abundant carbonate mineral on the surface of Earth, and assuming that your sample is 100% calcium carbonate maximized the chance that we will add acid in excess to neutralize all mineral carbonates in your sample.  \n",
    " \n",
    " We calculate the number of moles of calcium carboante from the mass of sample, in grams, as follows:\n",
    " \n",
    " > `moles_sample = mass_sample/100`\n",
    " \n",
    " moles_sample is the sample size in moles of calcium carbonate using the assumption all of your sample is made of that mineral. This is divided by 100 g/mol, the formula weight of calcium carbonate. \n",
    "\n",
    " Data are entered into the calculation cell below by pointing it to a .csv file on your computer. You can simply navigate to that file in a Finder or Windows Explorer window and copy the path, pasting it below between single quotes.

    "## How much acid is needed?\n",
    "  \n",
    "   To neutralize any carbonate minerals in your sample(s), a volume of acid is needed. We default to 10% HCl, but that can be changed in the code below.  Beware - most all of the previous runs in the Tulane and USF Ramped PyrOx facilities have been on samples treated with 10% HCl, and the concentration of acid can cause different reaction shapes (kinetics) when run on the \"Dirt Burner.\" Any change to acid concentration must first be well thought out - results may not be comparable to previous results!\n",

    "   >\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Finally, we convert that quantity of moles of HCl to a volume, assuming 10% HCl.  We evaluate this as mL of N% HCl because that is more practical for laboratory applications that may involve other concentrations, however these cases should be rare.  From a practical standpoint, we refer to concentrations of HCl in percentages because this translates well in the laboratory (i.e. 10% HCl is 10 mL of concentrate in 100 mL total solution).  It is important to know that concentrated HCl is listed as 36% HCl, and that translates to 11.65 M solution of HCl.  A 10% solution of that, then, is 1.165 M.\n",

    "5. Settle solids from liquid\n",
    "   * If in centrifuge tubes, centrifuge at 1300 rpm.\n",
    "   * If in beakers, let the samples settle out naturally - this can take several hours.\n",
    "6. Separate liquid supernatant from solid pellet\n",
    "   * Pasteur pipettes can used with a bulb or with the aspirator pump to draw off the liquid carefully. Do not disturb the sediment, or you will have to repeat step 5.\n",
    "7. Test the pH of the supernatant using pipette tips (wet with supernatant) and acid test papers.\n",
    "8. Add similar volume of DI H$_{2}$O to the calculated volume of acid, and repeat steps 5-7.\n",
    "9. When pH reaches 7 (which rarely happens) or plateaus above 4.5, samples can be dried. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "It is wise to record what volumes of acid and water (approximate for water) that you used and how many rinse steps it took to return to neutral. Neutral is seldom reached because DI H$_{2}$O has too few ions to measure on the test paper. You should also note which samples effervesce and for how long. "

    "## Publication Note\n",
    "Note that for publication of your results, you will not publish in %HCl.  Instead, we general use molarity or normality, with preference on normality.  Molarity is the number of moles of solute per liter; normality is the number of moles of H${^+}$ that is dissolved. For HCl, a 1 M solution is a 1 N solution because there is only one mole of H${^+}$ that dissolved for every mole of HCl!  Also note that we generally publish \"1N HCl\" for 10% HCl which is only true if you round to the nearest integer.  We prepare this acid with a graduated cylinder, so it is only appropriate to use one significant digit (hence 1 N). \n"
